*****IMAGE RENDERING INSTRUCTIONS*****

1. Upload the file to be rendered in the "ProjectFile" folder and remember the name as the Collab notebook will prompt you to enter it.

2. If the "Image" folder doesn't exist inside "RenderingImage" folder when you first copy the entire "BlenderRenders" project to Drive, create one.

3. The "Image" folder is where the rendered Image will be saved after rendering inside an appropriately named folder.

4. Goto the "RenderScript" folder and double-click on the file to open in Collab. Do not make any changes inside this folder or file.



NOTE : 

The default project in the "ProjectFile" is the BMW Render available on the Blender Website. Give it a try!
